  <p>Here at Salmon Cookies, we provide a new look towards eating cookies. Not only are our ingredients ALL locally sourced from our farms, but also 100% sustainable compostable products from local organic companies here in the Pacific North West. We are a family owned and operated company and pride ourselves in our dedication to Green Energy. Salmon Cookies puts forth the extra step to give the people a tasty, nutricious cookie, while also being able to shut down competition through cost and a "FULL CIRCLE ORGANICS" approach.</p>
